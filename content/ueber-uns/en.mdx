Timo Schneeweis recognized 20 years ago that flexibility in office infrastructure would become increasingly important for many companies in the future. At a time when no one was aware of the importance of "co-working" or "virtual offices", Timo Schneeweis founded the bizzcenter Konstanz in 2004.

The basic idea of offering companies flexible office solutions has remained the same to this day.

The original concept of offering furnished offices has now grown into a sophisticated range of services that can be combined individually or optionally in addition to the various office space options. Whether you are a start-up or a company operating nationwide, we offer you a cost-effective and plannable alternative to your own office infrastructure.

We now have over 120 customers, mainly small and medium-sized companies from the Lake Constance economic region and nearby Switzerland, but also multinational corporations. We have been working with many of our customers since the company was founded. For us, cooperation is always designed for the long term. Nevertheless, we offer you maximum flexibility with short contract terms.

Timo Schneeweis and Torben Götz have been working together in various companies since 2013. In January 2020, they opened bizzcenter Weil am Rhein GmbH, an independent bizzcenter in the Kesselhaus in Weil, directly on the Swiss border. Together, they are available to bizzcenter customers with over 35 years of entrepreneurial experience from numerous company start-ups in Germany and Switzerland. The backbone around Timo Schneeweis and Torben Götz is the well-established bizzcenter team with Beate Hafner, Carmen Nußbaumer and Soraya Malovcic.

Sustainable thinking and action have been a green thread running through the bizzcenter concept since 2004: the company operates in a CO2-neutral manner, relies on organic catering, green banking and regional suppliers as well as on the use of products that correspond to the philosophy of the bizzcenter. In the interests of the common good, the bizzcenter is also committed to regional, social and ecological issues. This makes the company an industry pioneer in Germany.
