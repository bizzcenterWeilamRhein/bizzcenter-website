In collaboration with the Economic Development Office of the City of Weil am Rhein, the innovative Green Office concept was created. In the listed halls of the former Schwarzenbach silk weaving mill, a unique concept for co-workers, start-ups and small businesses has been developed – an inspiring place for sustainable working and creative development.

The impressive ceiling height of 7.50 metres gives the hall a spacious, open feel and ensures a pleasant working atmosphere in the listed Kesselhaus Weil am Rhein. The ideal location directly in the tri-border region of Germany, France and Switzerland offers our customers a wide range of advantages.

With only 300 m to Basel, the Kesselhaus can be reached directly across the border with Basel tram line 8 (stop Riedlistr./Kesselhaus).

Our stylish offices provide a warm, quiet environment, while generous glass elements ensure plenty of daylight and an airy feel. A well-designed greening concept with potted and climbing plants creates a healthy indoor climate and promotes productive working.

Welcome to a new era of sustainable working!
