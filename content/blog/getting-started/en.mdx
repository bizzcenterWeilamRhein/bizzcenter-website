## Step 1: Create Your Account

Head to [app.my-website.com/signup](https://app.my-website.com/signup) and create your free account. You can sign up with your email address or use SSO with Google or GitHub. No credit card is required and the free plan has no time limit.

Once you verify your email, you will land in your new workspace dashboard. This is your home base for managing projects, team members, and settings.

## Step 2: Set Up Your Workspace

Your workspace is where everything comes together. Start by personalizing it:

- **Invite your team** — Go to Settings and then Team to add members by email. You can assign roles like Admin, Editor, or Viewer to control access.
- **Connect your tools** — Visit the Integrations page to link Slack, GitHub, Jira, or any of our 100+ supported services. Notifications and data will sync automatically.
- **Import existing data** — If you are migrating from another platform, use the one-click import tool to bring your projects, files, and history along.

## Step 3: Launch Your First Project

Click "New Project" from the dashboard and choose a template or start from scratch. Every project comes with built-in version control, analytics, and collaboration tools.

Once your project is ready, hit "Deploy" to push it live. Our global edge network handles the rest, delivering your content with sub-100ms latency worldwide.

## What Comes Next

Now that you are up and running, explore the [Features](/features) page to discover advanced capabilities like workflow automation, custom integrations, and analytics dashboards. If you have questions, our support team is always here to help.
