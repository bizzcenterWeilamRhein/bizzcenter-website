## Choosing the Right Template

When you create a new project, you can start from scratch or choose one of our pre-built templates. Templates come with sensible defaults for common use cases like marketing sites, internal dashboards, and API services.

For this tutorial, we will start with the "Starter" template. It includes a basic project structure, sample data, and a deployment pipeline that is ready to go.

## Configuring Your Project

Every project has a settings panel where you can customize behavior:

- **Environment Variables** — Store API keys, database URLs, and other secrets securely. They are encrypted at rest and never exposed in logs.
- **Custom Domains** — Add your own domain and we will provision an SSL certificate automatically. DNS changes typically propagate in under 10 minutes.
- **Webhooks** — Set up webhooks to trigger external services whenever specific events happen in your project.

Take a few minutes to review the defaults and adjust anything that does not match your requirements.

## Adding Collaborators

Projects support granular permissions. From the project settings, invite team members and assign one of three roles:

- **Admin** — Full access including billing and danger-zone settings.
- **Editor** — Can create, update, and deploy content.
- **Viewer** — Read-only access for stakeholders who need visibility.

Roles can be changed at any time without disrupting ongoing work.

## Deploying to Production

When you are happy with your project, click "Deploy" in the top-right corner. The platform runs your build pipeline, runs automated checks, and pushes the result to our global edge network.

Every deploy creates an immutable snapshot. If something goes wrong, you can roll back to any previous deploy in one click. There is no downtime during rollbacks.
