## Organize with Purpose

The most productive teams keep their workspaces clean and predictable. Here are a few patterns that work well:

- **One project per product or service** — Avoid cramming unrelated work into a single project. Separate projects are easier to manage, permission, and monitor.
- **Use consistent naming** — Agree on a naming convention early. Something like "team-product-environment" makes it easy to find what you need at a glance.
- **Archive instead of delete** — When a project wraps up, archive it rather than deleting it. Archives are searchable and can be restored if you need to reference old work.

## Automate Repetitive Work

Workflow automation is one of the most impactful features available. Start with the tasks your team does repeatedly:

- **Deployment notifications** — Send a Slack message every time a deploy succeeds or fails.
- **Review reminders** — Automatically nudge reviewers when a change has been waiting too long.
- **Data backups** — Schedule nightly exports of critical data to your own storage.

Each automation you add frees up time for the work that actually matters.

## Ship with Confidence

A reliable deployment process reduces stress and prevents outages. Follow these guidelines:

- **Use preview deployments** — Every branch can have its own preview URL. Share it with stakeholders for feedback before merging.
- **Enable automatic rollbacks** — Configure health checks so the platform can roll back a bad deploy before users notice.
- **Monitor after every release** — Check the analytics dashboard for error spikes or performance regressions in the first 30 minutes after a deploy.
