## What does that mean exactly?

Renting an office always involves a lot of effort and costs. We recognized this back in 2004, so we take all the work out of this process for you so that you can focus on your business.

<Features title="Our offices are already equipped with:">
  <Feature title="High-quality office equipment" description="First-class furniture and equipment for productive working" icon="check" />
  <Feature title="LAN/WLAN" description="High-speed internet for all requirements" icon="wifi" />
  <Feature title="Telephone/Fax" description="Optionally available" icon="phone" />
</Features>

We take over ancillary costs (water/electricity), office cleaning, and offer flexible additional office and conference rooms, mail processing, and short rental periods.

We are at your disposal as a competent partner with over 20 years of experience in flexible office services and company start-ups in Germany and Switzerland.
